        The Truth Untold<br><br>
        The 3rd track on Love Yourself: Tear, translates to <br>
“sincerity that couldn’t be delivered.” It references the<br>
 smeraldo flower, a fictitious flower that BTS has been <br>
associated with on more than one occasion. Similar to how <br>
different flowers can mean different things, the smeraldo means<br>
 “the truth I couldn’t tell,” according to the only flower shop <br>
that claims to sell it.<br>
There are similarities between the lyrics of the song and “La Città di<br>
 Smeraldo”, an Italian tale about a man who hides in his house because <br>
he’s afraid of showing himself. As he watches from the window, he falls in<br>
 love with a woman stealing flowers from his garden to sell them. Trying <br>
to help her, he grows a special flower, the smeraldo, so that she can earn<br>
 more money from it, but the woman dies before she is able to see it or meet<br>
 the man. Several quotes from the original story are written in the teaser posters<br>
 for the Love Yourself series
