        Blue & Grey<br><br>
        “Blue & Grey” is a guitar ballad that tells the story an artist’s<br>
        burn-out.<br>
       As V explained, blue is universally symbolic of sadness, while grey<br>
        is a color that RM often references in his songwriting to convey the same, <br>
       so V was inspired to use them both to describe that feeling.<br>
       
       “Blue & Grey” was originally intended to be on V’s mixtape and was entirely<br>
        in English. The group, however, liked it so much that they decided to work it <br>
       into the album BE. The snippet of the original version can be heard in episode <br>
       five of BTS' show, In The SOOP.<br>
