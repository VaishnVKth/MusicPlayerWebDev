        Fake Love<br><br>
        RM opened up about the true meaning of "Fake Love" and how<br>
        it actually fits into a bigger story that the group is trying<br>
        to tell through their music. "Basically, our albums are like a <br>
       four-part series; [the series] is about love. So [Love Yourself: Tear] <br>
       is part three and it's like a turning point. We're saying that if you're<br>
        not true to yourself, your love won't last forever. The love could be <br>
       person to person, it could be between me and myself," he explained. He <br>
       then joked, "It's kinda deep." And like, it kind of is though.<br>
